    "about": "An accordion is a vertically stacked set of interactive headings that each contain a title, content snippet, or thumbnail representing a section of content. The headings function as controls that enable users to reveal or hide their associated sections of content. Accordions are commonly used to reduce the need to scroll when presenting multiple sections of content on a single page.",

    "aboutConclusion": "In some accordions, there are additional elements that are always visible adjacent to the accordion header. For instance, a menubutton may accompany each accordion header to provide access to actions that apply to that section.

    "point-5": "If the accordion panel associated with an accordion header is visible, and if the accordion does not permit the panel to be collapsed, the header button element has aria-disabled set to true.",

    "point-6-2": "Role region is especially helpful to the perception of structure by screen reader users when panels contain heading elements or a nested accordion."
